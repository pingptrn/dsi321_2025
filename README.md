# Introduction
"Versioned Real-Time Air Quality Forecasting System using Prefect, lakeFS, and Docker"
This project delivers a production-ready pipeline to stream, forecast, and visualize real-time air quality data, orchestrated with Prefect 3. It integrates lakeFS for data version control, ensuring reproducibility and traceability across the data lifecycle. Docker provides environment portability, while GitHub supports CI/CD workflows. The system enables robust monitoring and forecasting through a modular and scalable architecture.
